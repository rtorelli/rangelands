<h4> <b> Mission </b> </h4>
<p> 
The western United States region's research community has made advances in characterizing the impacts of climate change on cattle production. However, there is a significant gap in translating this data into specific management implications that are relevant and useful for risk analysis and decision making. Our vision is to create a tool that will help users view and analyze data.

</p>

<h4> <b> Vision </b> </h4>
<p> 
This website is a means to explore and understand changing cattle production pressures in rangelands of the western United States. This is one part of a broader ongoing collaboration between the Washington State University's (WSU) Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources (CSANR) to characterize cattle production risks and management implications of a changing climate in the United States. Our goal is to give users a way to identify the regions that are most at-risk for reduced capacity. Users should also be able to quantify potential for regional redistributions in rangeland cattle inventory, and characterize their macroscale implications. This is to inform adaptation planning by the industry and affected communities, with a view to maximize benefits and minimize losses. Rangelands are grasslands, woodlands, wetlands, and deserts that are grazed by domestic livestock or wild animals. They contain all native vegetation that is not human influenced. The rangelands regions that we are concerned with are: Northwest, Southwest, Northern Plains, Southern Plains

As a first step, this website is a means to explore changing codling moth pressures, and associated pest management implications for the Washington State tree fruit industry. Expected changes to bloom timing in multiple apple varieties are also available. This is one part of a broader ongoing collaboration between the Washington State University's (WSU) <a href="http://csanr.wsu.edu/">Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources</a> (CSANR) and the WSU <a href="http://www.tfrec.wsu.edu/">Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center</a> (TFREC) to characterize production risks and management implications of a changing climate on Northwest tree fruit production. We have also initiated collaborations with other aspects of Pacific Northwest agriculture. So stay tuned for more this year!
